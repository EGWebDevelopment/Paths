# Creating a Path

## Team Paths

From the team, click on "Goals." This will take you to the Team's goal page. Next, click on "Create Path." This will take you into the first page in the Goal creation process.

## Entering Path Information

The purpose of this first page is to guide you through the process of defining the overall path. The fields here are Path Name, Notes, Image, and Attachments. The Path Name is used on the team goal page, personal goal page, and path log, so it is required. The Image replaces the default image, so it's optional. The notes and the attachments are not shown anywhere within the path structure.

## Creating Activities

The Activities are the groups of information that are delivered to [path participants ](/HKBpBwg1eP8#path-participants-)on a regular basis. Each Activity can have a title and a note, and will consistent of one or more [steps](/XkJ9Z9biBRZ#steps).

## Creating Steps

Like the Path and the Activity, each step will contain a Name and Notes. Steps, however, can have additional features depending on their [type](/vZVwKzz7hrT#type). The following types are currently available:

*   Custom
*   Attachment
*   Discussion and Attachment
*   Discussion

When a different type is selected, additional fields will appear. For example, if you choose "Attachment," a new area for attaching a resource will appear. Steps containing a [discussion board](/pZkFdCw2K13#discussion-board) will offer the option of enforcing a [word minimum limit.](/OBQGKbRrkgW#word-minimum-limit.) The Discussion-Attachment type of step combines the features of the Discussion and the Attachment steps under one interface.
