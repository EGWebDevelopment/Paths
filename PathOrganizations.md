# Path Organizations

Path organizations are used to associate path templates with different teams on the site. This allows us to add activities or make changes at the site level, and then distribute the changes to copies of that path which are stored inside different teams. Path organizations can be managed by clicking on the link in the admin menu.

Teams and paths are associated together in two steps. First, you would want to add any teams you would like included in the organization. Next, you would create the path. When you are ready, you copy the path to the different teams which will be working on the path.

Later, after you've made changes to a path that you would like distributed to the teams you "synchronize" the changes with each path. This means that the changes are being passed down to the copies of the path which belong to each user on a given path.
