The next page after the Path has been created and the activities have been entered is for Path settings. From this page, a user can mark the path as draft or active and enter in a [custom invitation message](/oLBnp84zFTe#custom-invitation-message).

## Advanced Settings

The Advanced Settings options can be revealed by clicking on the "Advanced Settings" link below the field for entering in a custom invitation message.
